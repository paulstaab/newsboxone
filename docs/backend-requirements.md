### Content Extraction And Summarization
- `CNT-001`: If feed metadata does not provide a thumbnail, the system shall extract the first image URL from HTML content when available.
- `CNT-002`: Optional full-text extraction from article URLs:
  - shall extract the text of the article from the articles website,
  - shall run only when the article URL TLD matches the feed URL TLD,
  - shall be skipped with a warning that includes both TLDs when the article URL TLD and feed URL TLD do not match.
- `CNT-003`: Feed content quality evaluation:
  - shall run when `last_quality_check` is missing or older than about 30 days,
  - shall use a representative feed entry that has both a link and feed-provided content or summary,
  - shall evaluate `use_extracted_fulltext` and `use_llm_summary` in the same periodic quality-check pass,
  - shall compare normalized feed content against extracted article content from the selected article URL,
  - shall treat extracted full text as higher quality only when the normalized extracted text is non-empty and at least twice as long as the normalized feed content,
  - shall persist the quality-check timestamp after a completed evaluation.
- `CNT-004`: Full-text and LLM summary enablement for feeds during quality evaluation:
  - `use_extracted_fulltext` shall be enabled only when feed content quality evaluation judges extracted full text to be higher quality,
  - `use_llm_summary` shall be evaluated independently of `use_extracted_fulltext`, after the content-quality decision determines the final article text to assess,
  - `use_llm_summary=true` shall mean that feed-provided summaries are not good enough and LLM-generated summaries should be used for that feed,
  - when LLM support is configured, the summary-quality check shall ask the LLM whether the feed-provided summary is a good standalone summary of the final chosen article text,
  - when LLM support is configured, `use_llm_summary` shall be enabled if the feed summary is missing or judged not good enough, and disabled if the feed summary is judged good enough,
  - when LLM support is not configured, the summary-quality check shall fall back to a heuristic that enables `use_llm_summary` when the normalized feed summary is missing or closely matches the beginning of the final chosen article text.
- `CNT-008`: Manual feed-quality overrides:
  - shall allow `use_extracted_fulltext` and `use_llm_summary` to be set independently per feed,
  - shall lock only the manually set attribute and leave the other attribute eligible for future automatic quality evaluation,
  - shall update the effective feed-level quality flag immediately when a manual override is applied,
  - shall update `last_quality_check` and a dedicated manual-override timestamp when a manual override is applied,
  - shall be cleared when the dedicated feed-quality re-evaluation command is run for that feed.
- `CNT-005`: Optional LLM-based article summarization when loading new articles:
  - shall run only for new articles after GUID-hash de-duplication confirms the article is not already stored,
  - shall be enabled only when LLM support is configured and LLM summarization is enabled for the articles feed,
  - shall strip HTML from article content before sending it to the model,
  - shall truncate article text to the first 8000 characters before LLM summarization,
  - shall request a concise plain-text summary in structured JSON form with a top-level `summary` field,
  - shall request the summary in newspaper article summary style,
  - shall request the summary in 2-3 sentences only,
  - shall request the summary in the same language as the article.
- `CNT-006`: Successful LLM-generated summaries shall:
  - be accepted only when a non-empty `summary` value is returned,
  - accept equivalent provider responses that wrap `summary` under the configured structured-output schema name,
  - include the suffix ` (AI generated)`.
- `CNT-007`: Automatic summary generation for articles without an existing summary:
  - shall run only for new articles before they are inserted into the database,
  - shall copy the full article content into the summary when content length is below 160 characters,
  - shall use LLM summarization only when content length is at least 160 characters and LLM summarization is both requested and enabled,
  - shall fall back to the first 160 characters plus `...` when content is long and LLM summarization is not requested, not enabled, or does not return a usable summary.

### Email Newsletter Ingestion
- `EML-001`: The system shall store IMAP credentials via CLI/API-internal paths.
- `EML-002`: Credential persistence shall require successful mailbox connectivity/login validation.
- `EML-003`: Update cycles shall fetch unread emails from configured mailboxes.
- `EML-004`: Only messages identified as mailing-list emails (for example via `List-Unsubscribe`) shall be treated as newsletters.
- `EML-005`: Mailing-list feeds shall be auto-created on first encounter of a sender.
- `EML-006`: Newsletter HTML shall be cleaned before article persistence.
- `EML-007`: Optional LLM-based newsletter parsing:
  - Optional LLM-based newsletter parsing shall be enabled only when LLM support is configured.
  - Before LLM-based newsletter parsing, newsletter content shall be truncated to the first 5000 characters.
  - LLM-based newsletter parsing shall support `single` mode and `multi` mode.
  - If a newsletter is a collection of links to different articles, it shall be parsed in `multi` mode. Otherwise, it shall be parsed in `single` mode.
  - In `single` mode, the parser should return the cleaned newsletter content as article and a concise, generated summary.
  - In `multi` mode, the parser should return an list of articles linked in the newsletter, so that they can be shown as separate entries in the generated feed.
  - LLM-based multi-item parsing shall create at most 25 articles from a single newsletter email.
- `EML-008`: If LLM-based parsing is disabled, fails, returns invalid JSON, or produces no usable multi-item entries, newsletter ingestion shall fall back to creating a single article from the cleaned email content.
- `EML-009`: Stale newsletter entries shall be eligible for cleanup only when older than 90 days, read, and unstarred.
- `EML-010`: Successful newsletter ingestion shall clear persisted refresh error state on the corresponding mailing-list feed.

### Observability
- `OBS-001`: All incoming API requests shall be logged at `INFO` level with the raw request URI, including query parameters when present.
- `OBS-002`: All outbound LLM requests shall be logged at `INFO` level with the task name and, when available, the associated `feed_id` and `article_id`.
- `OBS-003`: Extraction of article content as described in `CNT-002` shall be logged with `feed_id`, `article_id` loaded URL at `INFO` level.

### Security
- `SEC-001`: Remote URL validation shall allow only `http` and `https` schemes.
- `SEC-002`: Remote URL validation shall block loopback, private, link-local, unspecified, multicast, and cloud metadata addresses.
- `SEC-003`: Localhost access may be allowed only in testing mode.
- `SEC-004`: The same URL validation policy shall be applied consistently in all remote-fetch paths, including each HTTP redirect target before it is fetched, and hostname resolution failures shall be rejected rather than bypassing IP-based checks.
- `SEC-005`: HTTP Basic auth shall be enforced for the public API using configured `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` credentials.
- `SEC-006`: The system shall not log user-provided content, including titles, feed content, mailbox identities, or externally generated content derived from user input unless explicitly required by an `OBS` requirement.

### Configuration
- `CFG-001`: Runtime configuration shall be sourced from environment variables.
- `CFG-002`: Supported variables shall include authentication settings, feed update frequency, service version, and provider-specific LLM configuration including request timeout.
- `CFG-003`: Defaults shall include `VERSION=dev`, `FEED_UPDATE_FREQUENCY_MIN=15`, `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30`, and a default LLM model identifier.

### CLI
- `CLI-001`: A CLI `update` command shall initialize persistent storage access and execute a refresh cycle.
- `CLI-002`: A CLI `add-email-credentials` command shall require server, port, username, and password inputs.
- `CLI-003`: `add-email-credentials` shall return a user-visible error when credential validation fails.
- `CLI-004`: A CLI `reevaluate-feed-quality` command shall require a regular-feed ID, fetch that feed, clear any manual feed-quality overrides for that feed, and force re-evaluation of the feed-level `use_extracted_fulltext` and `use_llm_summary` quality flags without ingesting articles.
- `CLI-005`: A CLI `set-feed-quality` command shall require a regular-feed ID plus at least one of `use_extracted_fulltext` or `use_llm_summary`, persist manual overrides for the provided attributes, and update the effective feed quality flags immediately.

### Data Model And Constraints
- `DAT-001`: Persistence shall include `Feed`, `Folder`, `Article`, and `EmailCredential` entities.
- `DAT-002`: Feed URL uniqueness shall be enforced.
- `DAT-003`: Folder name uniqueness shall be enforced.
- `DAT-004`: Feed persistence shall store nullable per-attribute manual quality-override fields for `use_extracted_fulltext` and `use_llm_summary`, plus a timestamp for the most recent manual override.
